          The day is ready to make it rise.<br>
          It roasts, it bakes, it fries.<br>
          Then it's good to take a swim,<br>
          in the ocean with joy to the brim.

        <p>
          The waves carry tides that the world is greedy.<br>
          When work and duty must feel so needy.<br>
          As the clocks tick to a quarter to four<br>
          you feel like you need a whole lot more.

          The day is ending, it's getting later<br>
          It's time to change the day to greater<br>
          Where better to be, yes be so free<br>
          than where your hearth wants to be.

          The day has ended and the night takes hold.<br>
          You dream sweet dreams of the beaches gold.<br>
          And you know that tomorrow it will begin anew.<br>
          To make you rise and make dreams true.
