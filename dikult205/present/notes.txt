    arguments for discussing visual document design (WWW).

Use it for pushing the visually-embedded documents to becomming 
    more successful and accessible through the classical retoric
    arguments.

(OWN OBSERVATIONS) -> The visuals are not just added with haste
    at the end, but rather path of the foundation in good rethorical
    documents.

    Chapter 4: Summerize.
        Are the visual documents created with the same principles
        that oral speeches and written texts are?


CHAPTER TWO:
    Ethos:
        Classical: 
            credibility and character.
        Aristotle:
            Focus oral communication
            Rethoric: an ability, in each particular case,
                to see the available means of persuation
            Believe fair minded people in many cases and especially
                where there are room for doubt
            Practical visdom: [phronēsis]
                "I have 20 years experience in the field"
            Virtue: [aretē]
                "Morale character and honor"
            Good Will: [eunoia]
                "disposition toward the audience"
            All must be fulfilled if not everything falls apart.
        SELF:
            Can ethos be created? And therefore be established 
                in the website as a building block when 
                conveying information.
            Convey VS convince.
    Cicero:
        Three parts:
            Proving contentions.
            Winning over our audience.
            inducing their minds to feel any emotion the case may demand.
        Orator(Speaker)
            new view: Speakers actions over character.
            People's minds are won over by a man's prestige, his accomplishments
            and the reputation he has acquired by his way of life.
            MOS MAIORUM (family reputation)
        For Aristotle ethos has nothing to do with emotions,
            while for Cicero, he argues that to be won over one must be 
            infused with the required emotions. (Humility and gentleness).
