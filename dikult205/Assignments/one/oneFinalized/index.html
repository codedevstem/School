              <p>The most incendiary issue I’ve been dealing with here in Los Angeles (where I live) has been the whole “Legalization of Marijuana” debate. Both sides are very passionate about changing the law, and both sides have good arguments for effecting this change, but no one seems to want to do the homework and get the information for themselves. And this is a problem because without the right information, it’s very easy to get the issue confused.</p>

              <p>Contrary to the beliefs of those who advocate the legalization of marijuana, the current balanced, restrictive, and bipartisan drug policies of the United States are working reasonably well and they have contributed to reductions in the rate of marijuana use in our nation. </p>

              <p>The legalise marijuana movement has some powerful backers and is making political gains. But Arizona addiction psychiatrist Dr Ed Gogek, who used the drug himself in his youth but has treated over 10,000 addicts and alcoholics during his medical career, insists that legalization would have seriously harmful consequences for teenagers and society.</p>
