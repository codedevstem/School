    Hello!
        My name Kristian Os and talk about Breanna Lee Byers
        Rhetorical analysis of visual Web design.
2: 
    Two sites
        SHAZAM Inc.
           SHAZAM Inc is a Big corporation and an electronic funds transfer(EFT) 
           A network that serves financial institutions. 
           Provide information to interested customers and want to engage with them to 
           make them use the services that SHAZAM can provide.
           Also establish trust.
        The second site is Flyway: A journal of Writing and Environment
            It is a non profit organisation that strives to inspire visitors on environmentalism
            and also give them a place for litterature on the subject
3:
    Her analysis is focused on ethos. So phronesis(practical knowledge), arete(Virtue) and eunoia(Goodwill)
    She has in the thesis defined this and is going to use the classical definitions of Aristotle,
    Cicero and Quintilian. 
    She has analysed only the welcome and about pages
4: 
    Starting with the conditions that ethos should 
    -establish
    -inspire
    -assist
    Kostelnick and Roberts interpretation of tone is used here with the classical definitions.
5:
    Read off the presentation.
6,7:
    Convey what the picture show
        welcome page
        About page
8: 
    Professionalism over all things.
    stability!
9:
    No nonsence
    section with different typefont (Sloppy work)
    Boldness, not to scream, but to show smaller parts.
    Seems a bit unprofessional.
10:
    Headings (How they look, not placed)
    bullets
    Where are they?
    Structure is important to convey continuety.
11:
    Pictures
    Relate
    What does the pictures convey and what does the logos convey.
12:
    The links
    Colour and variations
13:
    Flyway, no pictures of about page I think
14:
    Professionalism and environmentalism
    read the points and elaborate (DO IT!)
15:
    Serif: Academic and liteerature
    Sans serif: for text easy to read and skim.
16:
    Structure 
        nice for some and ruins it for others. Logic is different for everyone
    bullets
17:
    Us nature, but not much. Tacky.
    Go urban already saved the grass.
    A cage for nature and the writers.
    Contact with the designers said that the logo was ugly, but the founder 
    will not change it. Unknown reason
18:
    Links nice, but is not obvious
    Lacking credibility (Kostelnick and Roberts KEY)
    No animations (Outdated now) (A bit old in our days) (The web has come far)
    Strong with colours and identity.
19:
    AMAZON
        Welcome page
            gives us the option to sign up, no forcing(goodwill, virtue)
            Already known (Credibility) Just the logo conveys credibility
            Inspires shopping through real people and real products.
            Links to whatever you might
